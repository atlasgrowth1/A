He was able to do the job for less in less than 20 minutes (most of that time was me yapping anyways). He was kind, courteous, and the most helpful. I won't be going to any other plumbing company.",

        "text": "I would recommend this business to anyone! Saying that I am pleased, would be an understatement. For multiple years my warranty company has assigned contractors to my home to repair my AC & absolutely no other contractor has succeeded with making my home comfortable for my family. I was so blessed to have Tony sent out by warranty! He knew absolutely everything that needed repairing & replacing and assured me that he would get me and my family straight. Customer service is amazing! He definitely went out of his way to respond about any of my concerns and was so emphatic! He actually cares about his customers well being and that is RARE. He made sure the repairs/replacements were handled for me the same day parts arrived! After 5 years, my home is finally feeling amazing. Thanks to Tony & Everyone who is apart of TSquare! Stay blessed & I pray much more success to this business. So deserving!",

        "text": "I called T Square after having another very large company do an eval and give me a quote to repair my AC. I felt like I was being scammed and wanted a second opinion. T Square promised me they'd see me at 11am today, they didn't lie. They looked at the issue, diagnosed it, and fixed it without trying to sell me parts and units that I didn't need.\n\nThey were professional, knowledgeable, and personable. Plenty of people would try to take advantage of the recent heat wave and know that people are desperate for working AC, but that's not how T Square handled it. They were very straightforward, explained the issue once it was diagnosed, and showed the fix. Afterwards, they checked to be sure everything was working, tested the temperature, and made sure I was satisfied with the job.\n\nI can't say enough good things about these guys. I'm glad I found them. Having AC problems is awful, finding good service is usually worse. Do yourself a favor and call T Square. It's too hot to get jerked around by crooks.",

He was able to track down which part was faulty and repair it quickly, efficiently, and affordably. But that's not the best part of using T Square. Tony, himself, is delightful.

First warranty company contractor was at our house for 20 minutes and said everything was fine. They took our deductible and refused to return our calls. We knew there was a problem and disputed the eval. 911 Air immediately identified multiple holes in our coil and offered us a great price on a new system.  Without hesitation, they did extra work for no cost that wasn't included in the initial quote. Really great company. Very impressed with the honesty, professionalism, and customer service. Ricky installed and services our system and can't say enough good things.",

Danny always gives me options on how to repair or correct my AC systems, and is up front with me on what I need, what I have to have, and what I don't need.  The prices he charges are very reasonable and the service is top notch.  He just replaced my 4 ton AC system at my home, but that was my choice.  I chose the new system over a repair that I could have made to my 11 year old system.  It is very nice to have an HVAC company (and a contractor in general) that I can trust.",

I chose 911 Air because of the great reviews, and it was the right choice! Danny returned my call promptly, came on time, and was able to fix the issue easily (simple broken wire). He was up front and let me know that my unit was very old, just so I could be aware of issues in the future. I'm so glad he did, and any ol' technician could have just as easily told me the unit needed to be replaced right then, since it was so old. Thank you Danny for quality, trustworthy work!",

You can tell they take pride in their work and truly care about their customers. With over 25 years of experience, they know their stuff and get the job done right the first time.\n\nIt’s hard to find folks these days who are this dependable, but that’s exactly what you get with Henderson Heating and Air. If you need HVAC work done by people who actually care, look no further. Highly recommend!",

This company is incredible and had a tech out incredibly fast. Andrew did an absolutely outstanding job diagnosing and explaining the problem then went above and beyond to make sure we were beyond satisfied with the results. When it’s time for any cooler or refrigeration repair this will be the first place I call every time and we are asking for Andrew every time.\n\nThank you so much!",

        "text": "After nearly 30 years in my home I’ve had several recognizable AC companies in town work on my HVAC and more often than not been left disappointed with one thing or another. This company was recommended to me be a friend who had a good experience so I called. It was during the first warm days of spring and everyone was slammed but Taylor made every effort to get to me in a timely manner. The first impression was a knowledgeable and friendly staff with a very professional truck and equipment. I was prepared for the worst but after a thorough inspection it was diagnosed as a bad starter capacitor. The brand that Taylor uses has a 5 year warranty. It’s unheard of for electronic/electric parts to have any warranty but Taylor explained that he insists on providing premium components for his clients and it saves time and money in the long run. Overall they had me back up and cooling off in no time. . Clear and precise communication combined with prompt service (he gave me a ballpark time and then called 30 minutes before arriving) and professional appearances and extremely reasonable pricing made me feel like I have found a HVAC I can depend on for all my future needs. I can’t speak highly enough about how satisfied I am with the work and new relationship. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of work on there systems.\nA+ experience and I will use them again!",

He didn't come in over budget and stuck to his original prices even after a few items were added to complete the job right.

So I gave him a call, 20 minutes later he was at my home. He had it fixed in no time and he was very polite and professional. I got back in town and received a text from him,he was just checking to make sure everything was still good. Now that's the type of customer care that will keep me coming back.

He explained a million things to me, as well as the Freon would be $200 a pound, at that moment I knew we were not going to use them but I let them finish trying to find whatever else could be broken. Mr buddy comes in and tells me it’s $450 because he went ahead and put Freon in saying he was under the impression that I wanted my a/c to run, yes yes I do but definitely not for that price. So he did what he wanted and charged us for it anyway. Don’t recommend one bit.",

        "text": "Awesome Experience using Martin Service Heating and Air! We called two local companies to check out our units after our home was struck by lightning recently.  Martin Service arrived with parts in hand within an hour of us calling them on a Saturday afternoon.  They had us back up and running within hours and charged us thousands less than the other company had quoted and they were able to do the work immediately.  They were super professional, gave us a great price and had everthing installed and cleaned up within just a few hours. The even went the extra mile by following up the next day to make sure we were happy with the repairs.  I highly recommend you use them. They were referred to me by our electrician who said he wouldn't use anybody but them to do work for him.",

He was here first thing the next morning and was extremely kind. He climbed into our freezing attic and was able to fix our issue very quickly. He took pictures of everything so that we could see exactly what he saw and worked on. He did let us know we would likely have to replace our unit in the next couple of years, but for now it should be fine. He didn’t try to push any unnecessary parts, or services on us, and the cost of services we did receive was more than reasonable. We will be using them for all of our hvac needs moving forward!",

        "text": "They came to fix  a busted water pipe under my house, that was flooding my bathroom floor. They came quickly, which I appreciated very much. They got the job done quickly as well. BUT several hours after they left, we went outside and noticed they didn’t even use the entrance that’s already there on one side of the house to access the area under my house! Instead the ripped some of my underpinning off!  It looks awful now and it ripped the top of the pieces on both sides away from the house as well! I’ve never even heard of anyone doing that. All they had to do was ask where the entry was. I’m really surprised that any professional company would destroy your property and leave it on the ground without even mentioning it. So disappointed with that. Doubt I will use them again. It makes me question their decision making capabilities.",

They showed up on time, even called before hand to verify address and that someone would be home. After servicing my 17 year old R-22 unit, checking on prices to repair or replace, we discuss the options and for me that was replacing the unit. We discuss the different unit options and their benefits. Help with financing if I wish. With this information I was able to make an informed decision and schedule my install. Air logistics personnel were courteous and professional throughout. After finishing the install, in the rain I will add, they made sure everything was clean and all trash was removed.

All the other companies in Birmingham that tout themselves as being the best couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my ac unit.

        "text": "Recently I had a mini split added to my office. They also reran my ductwork and added zone thermostats to all 3 levels to my split level. Now my one unit heats and cools my entire house effectively. Adams heating showed up when they said they would and were very professional the entire time. I highly recommend Richard Adams and his crew. 5 out of 5. Thank, got to love a locally owned company that does it the right way.",

Arthur meet me at my house and got my AC cooling my house! He was quick to diagnose the issue, explained what was wrong, and got to work making sure everything was running well. Afterward, Karen called and checked to see if everything was cooling off. This was the best HVAC service I’ve used. I 100% recommend using them if you need fast and dependable service.",

Usually when I have a technician to come out, they are trying to anticipate or predict what the problems could be, not with Comfort Specialist.

I have not been around a specialist that was detailed, knowledgeable, and most of all, very informative of product selections and the entire HVAC system. After dealing with this specialist, I felt like I became more knowledgeable of my HVAC system. I strongly recommend that you call them for your HVAC system needs. Outstanding organization.",

At first, I thought it was a minor issue, but it turned out the motor had burned out due to electrical fuse wear. Leo's inspection and repair were very professional. He also did an evaluation and monitoring for me, telling me which parts could hold up for now and what to keep an eye on. I've had too many repairmen try to convince me to replace things that don't really need replacing, but Leo was very honest and gave advice from my perspective. The final cost was also very reasonable.",

        "text": "Do not use this company. Charlie, the owner, is rude and unprofessional. I have a home warranty company that called them to my home to fix some ducts that fell and were cooling my crawl space instead of my home. They are 56 years old. It's bound to happen. Well, because I had cable installed three months ago, Charlie told them that the cable guy must have knocked the ducts loose and that's why they fell. This is a flat out lie. You cannot prove that someone knocked them down unless you saw them do it. Believe me I would have called a long time ago if that was the case.There is other duct work that has fallen nowhere near where the cables were installed, but those won't be covered either because it's all the same system.  The ducts fell only in the last week or so. Charlie was never at my home to do the inspection and the person who was at my home said that it was due to old age. But because Charlie said otherwise only looking at pictures, my home warranty company will not be covering the cost. Now I will have to hire someone on my own, and you bet it will not be One Call. Not to mention their prices are much higher than most anyway.",

The installers got the carpet in OK; however, the installation agency Home Depot hired failed to tell the nice installers they needed to have the nail gun on hand to install the Shoe Molding. My husband and son were very nice to handle the Shoe Molding removal for them. Our initial agreement when the porch was measured was to handle ALL of the Shoe Molding necessaries. I do not blame the installers and they did a nice job with what they could accomplish. I  believe our experience with Home Depot was due to the fact that they use an installation contractor, so they cannot stand behind the installation. Lowe's is our favorite now!",

He came out the same day we put in a request, quickly assessed the issue, and clearly communicated about what needed to happen for a repair as well as how long it might be before they could do it. He returned the next afternoon and we had cold air again in almost no time!\n\nHe was personable, professional, clear in communication and very knowledgeable. I would 100% recommend him to anyone!",

It is so refreshing to see young men that are clean cut, never using profanity or smoking and always respectful. And their prices are reasonable. But the most important thing: they do it right.

I kid you not, we had techs from other companies come out 15 times, we called the manufacturer, had multiple parts replaced under warranty, it was a mess. No one could figure it out. After working on it every few weeks for a year and getting nowhere, it was just getting to be a joke how bad it was. But then someone told me about Scott with Airloc. He came out, got in the weeds with it, did some serious sleuthing, and got to the bottom of the issue. He charged us a fair price and he took a big thing off my plate.

        "text": "UPDATE JULY 2023 - First AC and heating system were still going strong, but we moved into another house and had to replace one of its two heat/air units. Extra challenging as it included a water-based Aquatherm heat exchanger for the winter use. Airloc was in and out in a day, with zero problems as of a few weeks later. Also, Scott helped me limp the old system along a few weeks while we unsuccessfully tried to get American Home Shield to live up to at least part of our home warranty. Too hot to wait another month on AHS, but Airloc pricing was fair and quality of installation top notch.\nNovember 2020 review - Scott worked up all the estimates I requested for conventional and heat pump units. Airloc installed the complete replacement conventional Trane gas furnace and air conditioning components, even the blower all for less than the \"Big Boys\" around Birmingham. Two months on, have used both the heat and A/C a few times each with excellent results. Electric and gas bills have come way down. Highest recommendation on all counts.",

        "text": "Scott's dedication to service and treat his customers like they are his family is so apparent in every aspect of the process.  Scott took the time to review our building plans for finishing a basement, taking additional measurements, spending time in the space and then making multiple recommendations to allow us to make the best decision for our family and for our needs.  Then during the installation process, he let us know when he will be working on which aspect of the installation.  When an instance comes up that requires him to get additional fittings, he let us know what he needed and when he would be back to finish up - and he followed through and finished ahead of his initial schedule!   Airlock had finished installation of our two other units during the construction phase of our home when the contractor's HVAC guys did not show up - even though it wasn't the manufacturer he represents!  He has always been diligent and honest in all the work he has done for our family.  We would give Scott and Airlock more than 5 stars if Google gave us that option!  We will be using Airlock for years to come for regular maintenance and system upgrades.  Thanks again for a fantastic job!  The robotics team especially thanks you!!",

He was able to come out the same day I called to give me an estimate. He also explained all the details of the installation and financial aspects that I was concerned about which put my mind at ease. I knew right away that we were in good hands! On day two he called and within 3-5 minutes we worked out the financing and on day three installation! Scott really goes above and beyond with great service. Even when faced with old wiring issues in my home for the new thermostat he stayed longer than planned to finish the job. Before Airloc we used to be on with Brown’s and when we got our quotes from them they were ludacris (not even for the top of the line system) and definitely trying to take advantage of us, warning us that we only had a few days to make our decision or loose the “loyal customer discount”. Airloc’s prices are on point (even for the top of the line). They are honest, fair and choosing them for my heating and cooling needs was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made! We are so thankful for Scott! We will always entrust our HVAC and Heating system at this home and also any future home with Scott at Airloc! You should too! Call them now!",

He installed the thermostats, explained our system, and was professional, smart, and fast. Airloc is an awesome family business serving the Birmingham region.",

It’s also getting close to 100 this weekend. I was truly devastated at what this meant for my weekend!\n\nScott got in touch immediately and I filled him in on what was happening. He felt like he knew what it was, and said he would be out around 1pm. He ended up being able to come at 10:30 am - Praise Jesus! He ran and got a part after confirming what it was and had the air back on by 1pm.\n\nI’ve used some of the other HVAC folks in town but never had prompt and responsive service like this. I would recommend him to anyone!\n5-star service all the way around! We can continue to enjoy our Memorial Day weekend! Thank you Airloc!",

They have been great in every way, whether price,communication, being on time, or Misty keeping me updated throughout the process. I use them personally as well and recommend them to any of my friends who need something done but aren't sure who to use. A friend bought me dinner one night because Campbell was $1,100 less than the price another company had quoted for the job.\n\nIf you are looking for honest, quality, work at a very competitive price and are reading this, your search has ended\n\nParker Anderson",

The technician had the part on his truck & made the repair immediately, after giving us the pricing upfront.\n\nI worked on the administrative side of the hvac business for almost 10 years, so my expectations for service were high. Campbell's checked all the boxes. Our issue was resolved within 2 hours from making the initial call. We will have them back to do our bi-annual maintenance from now on. Highly recommend!",

We recently had an issue where the unit wasn’t running so we made the call to Campbell’s and they were out promply and had it repaired in no time! Very reasonable costs and highly dependable!",

Now that the unit is getting older I'm trying to milk every year I can out of it. The house was not cooling so I called them and they came out today ...unit is in good shape. They cleaned the coils and checked everything out. Come to find out one of the branch ducts had come aloose and cool air was going under the house ....this was fixed and it's getting cooler now as I type. We keep the house cold like 65 degrees during the hot summer months. We work outside and it's always nice to come home to a cool house. Thanks to the tech that came out he was awesome.",

        "text": "This is my second great experience with this company! The first time around, I asked them to give me a second opinion after being told I needed a whole new system by someone else. They told me I did not need a new system, and made a repair that cost maybe $100 instead of the thousands I would have spent otherwise. This time, one of their techs, Noah, was able to solve a strange problem I was having with my thermostat not reading correctly even though it was functioning fine, and the system was functioning fine—something no one else has been able to solve. (Let's just say it was actually an insulation issue, not an HVAC issue. But he still fixed it.) I'm thankful for their trustworthiness because that can be hard to find. Would absolutely recommend them to everyone I know.",

After getting a quote from a well known 5⭐️ company in Birmingham, I had sticker shock at the replacement cost for a unit that was not near the quality of a Trane and a downgrade compared to my current specs. A friend recommended Chris Kelley at Absolute Air. What a lifesaver. He arrived within two hours after my call. He quoted me an American Standard (maker of Trane) that significantly upgraded my current seer rating and added a variable speed versus single stage unit. His price cremated the previous company’s quote with a superior product and upgrade. Unit was installed less than 48 hours later. Excellent service techs that were polite and so helpful. I don’t think I have ever been so impressed with an HVAC company. Thank you Chris.",

But he's not reliable.\n\nHe had already been to my house on a couple of calls over the last couple of years, and did a great job. Back in October, I left him a voice mail on his cell phone to check my HVAC unit. No reply.\n\nA few days later I texted him, and got a return text he would get back to me later. I never heard from him.\n\nHis voice mail says call his office for immediate help. I then left a message with a woman who answered the phone, who i assume was his secretary. She said she would pass the message on to him and he would call to set up an appointment. I never heard from him. In my book, three strikes and you're out.\n\nI have no idea why he didn't want the business. But even if I had been a new customer, if he didn't want the business, or was too busy and didn't have time, you would think he would have the professional courtesy to call and say he was too busy. Or call back and say something.\n\nI called Norrell, who was recommended by some friends. They responded immediately and fixed the problem at a reasonable rate. I won't be calling Absolute Air again.",

        "text": "We've used Douglas since moving to Birmingham and each time they come out I am impressed with the technicians and their service.  Jonathan Sales, the technician that visited our home today, was no exception.  He was on time, personable, professional, communicative, took the time to explain everything so I felt confident and knowledgable, and he was extremely kind and considerate.  Jonathan was great to work with.  Consistently awesome service, and awesome techs.  Jonathan went above and beyond.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  Thanks Douglas and Jonathan for taking such great care of our home and us.\n\n2025 Update Regarding Plumbing Services:  Our neighborhood plumber retired so we were looking for someone to help us out with plumbing needs.  We decided to give Douglas a try after having such great experiences with them on the heating/cooling side.  It was another great experience with Douglas! Easy to schedule, quick service, and Jeremy was great!  He was on time, personable, professional, explained the issue and the solution, fixed it up for us and even came back out regarding a question I had.  Thank you Douglas and Jeremy for continuing to care for our home!",

He did a great job at answering all my questions. I am a Robotics Engineer and it was impressive to hear him talk about my HVAC system like I talk about robots. Very high level. He found my starter capacitor out of tolerance with his meter and explained to me what it meant. So, I bought a capacitor as well. It’s very refreshing to meet Tradesmen that know their craft, and that are personable with a great attitude.\nGreat experience. Ya’ll need to promote that guy",

        "text": "Douglas Cooling and Heating went above and beyond my expectations! Brandon, the service technician, was smart, thorough, polite, and incredibly informative. Most importantly, he was honest. For years, I dealt with a dripping coil issue that two major HVAC companies misdiagnosed, costing me money, health problems, and constant headaches. One of these companies even had me on a maintenance plan and recommended replacing my entire system for over $20K.\n\nBrandon came in, diagnosed the issue correctly, and fixed it quickly, saving me from unnecessary expenses. His expertise and transparency were refreshing after the frustrating experiences with other “Major “ companies. I can't recommend Douglas cooling and Heating enough—top-notch service!\n\nI am forever grateful (Thank You)!",

        "text": "Normally would not put anything bad up about a company, BUT these folks deserve it, royally.  Jay and their team have worked on my system since they acquired KS Services a couple years ago and since they have been extremely difficult to even get over to the house to do work.  When they do come, all you hear about is how bad everything is and recommend things that don’t make since.  They installed dampers for zones that don’t work at all, installed ducts that don’t need to be there and when I asked them to remove them they just taped up the hole they made and left the huge duct sitting in my cellar.  The worst part of their company (which is a tough thing to determine) is their attitude and customer service, though.  My board got zapped by a storm last Friday and was without AC over the weekend (this is early August, some of the hottest days of the year).  I tried calling them probably 8 times.  They have an answering service.  Every time I called the operator said they have been in touch with them, and that they would call me right back.  Of course, nothing.  The next Monday morning I start calling again and they would pickup the phone and then hang up.  Thought it was a mistake but I called multiple times and heard them pickup and then hang up.  Eventually I emailed Jay Douglas, and he said I should contact the salesman from the prior company to get it fixed.  What?  They don’t exist and they bought the customer book (me).  What a coward.  Their work sucks.  Their attitude sucks.  And they will make you miserable if you become a customer.  Can’t recommend that you run as fast as you can, like I am, away from this company.",

        "text": "I would recommend Douglas Heating and Air to my mother.\n\nThe first thing to say is that my job wasn't easy. It required fitting a new system into older duct work, getting up to code, and off site fabrication of fitting pieces. Plus, I needed both heating and cooling. So, this job was not an easy one.\n\nWith all that said, Douglas exceeded my expectations. Scheduling began the job, and the guy I talked to worked with me to find a date that would work around my homeschool schedule and my wife's work - no easy arrangement in itself. Then, the sales rep arrived to look at my system. The arrangement was just to look at what was going on, and the salesman walked in took one glance at the situation, and said, \"So, we're replacing this, right?\" I had a ton of questions given such a quick response. The salesman with a patience that defies reason explained each section not up to code, the problems seen with the heating, and the failures of the cooling. Every detail was pointed out to me. That's a level of professionalism that I haven't encountered.\n\nAt long last the replacement job arrives, a two man crew arrived at my house. They, initially, went through the steps of seeing where the job was and getting access. Then, the lead guy took the time to explain to me what the plan was. For example, the air conditioner would happen at this point; the heater at that point, and you may expect this, that, and the other thing during the process. As a result, I could handle the kids with the loud noises. Even after they completed the work [no small feat as I said], they showed me the results of what they did. The lead took me to each connection, showed me the outcome of the off site fabrications, and explained to me how the new thermostat worked - gave me a complete tutorial.\n\nSo, if you're looking for someone to do the job with technical accuracy, you've found your crew. If you're looking for some value added as far as customer service and professionalism, then pick Douglas Heating & Air.",

        "text": "Delivers on their word! I called to get a custom chimney chase cover made because they (Douglas) showed up on a Google search. They called me back within hours,  took my dimensions,  and told me it would be ready by the next day.  Guess what? It actually was. Very reasonably priced and they called me to let me know it was ready to pick up.  Basically, my review is,  Douglas does what they say they are going to with no suprises, which is rare these days.  I highly recommend them if that is the kind of service that you're looking for.",

We called Douglas because we had used them before and been pleased with their work.  The technician they sent to our house was Richey...  he was extremely knowledgeable, polite, professional and thorough.  The outside AC unit was extremely dirty,  but Richey didn’t stop until he had it clean!  It looked like a new unit!  Thanks Richey!  We heartily recommend Douglas for all your HVAC needs!\n\nUpdate:  Had to call Douglas the next day; the outside unit was still having issues coming on.  Richey came back out and quickly found the fan was bad.  Same friendly, professional service - and I would give them 5 stars all over again.  Highly recommend!  Thanks Douglas!",

Keith was able to identify my problem and suggest the Mitubishi Single Zone Heat Pump. Jamie and Terry had my unit installed in 8 hours and took meticulous care with covering my carpet and their walking path to their truck. Very impressive. Ricky and Russell installed dampers to cut the air flow to that room in order to keep the main area of the upstairs cool. They did a great job of not tracking a mess around my house since they had to work in my attic and were finished by mid morning. Again, very impressive. John came to train us on how to operate my new unit and adjust the dampers if needed. Sara was very sweet and handled payment by phone. I am a very satisfied customer and highly recommend the team at Douglas Heating and Cooling.",

Once there, Richey diagnosed our problem quickly and recommended a change in equipment that would serve us well.\n\nRichey installed our new system yesterday, was very competent in doing so, and demonstrated his knowledge of HVAC systems over and over.

I had them come back out this year cause I was having issues after I just spent 1,500 with them last year. This service was horrible they didn't fix it, charged over 200 dollars. Then gave me quotes for 3500 and 7000 and said my unit was done I needed a new one. I sweated it out for a few and got a second option, the other company came out and fixed it for under 200 and gave amazing service. I called this company back and was trying to explain how I felt taken advantage of and the office manager was rude he kept trying to tell me he didn't think his tech would do that but I watched the new company I had come out rewire it and it started working. Long story short don't use them, they'll over charge you and lie to you. Try Service Tech inc. they are amazing and service is the best!",

Chris came out the same day we called. He was very courteous, took his time and was very thorough.  He fixed the wiring in the thermostat unit, inspected the air handler under the house, and the return. He inspected the box of the thermostat to make sure he did not miss anything.  Problem solved!

Keely and her folks represent our company better than any of the others that we work with.  Today I was called by a new client who stated that Holland's tech found things that the previous THREE companies missed.  And in doing so, actually suggested that they didnt need a new system, but improved insulation because the current system is large enough.  Let me rephrase that, the tech DID NOT sell them what they were asking for, and what was approved by the budget department of this large property management firm, and in doing so, saved them approximately $4000.  THAT IS SERVICE.  This company manages thousands of properties in the metro area, Holland didn't even know that fact.  Guess who is getting the call first the next time??",

        "text": "This is a company that treats you like family!  I lost my air last Saturday and contacted HACS late afternoon.  The temperature in my home was hovering around 86 degrees.  The lady that I spoke to was very caring and easy to speak to.  She was attempting to send a technician out Saturday night, but I told her it was o.k. to setup the appointment for Sunday morning due to bad weather in the area.  She contacted me early Sunday to let me know that the technician was on the way to my home.  They also have an automated texting system that notified my cell when the technician was on the way.  The technician Billy arrived quickly and started to diagnose the issue with the outside air condenser after I told him the symptoms.  Billy was a great guy to work with and was very knowledgeable.  Billy told me that I defiantly had a bad capacitor and possibly a compressor.  I pretty much knew the capacitor was bad before he even arrived onsite.  Due to having a 13-year-old odd name 5-ton system Billy didn’t have the right capacitor on the truck.  He asked me how bad I wanted it fixed on Sunday due to the warehouse being closed and it would cost a small fee to open.  I told him that I was hot and willing to pay the small fee.  Billy left the house and came back about an hour later to repair the unit.  When Billy pulled up I stopped him from repairing the unit.  I told him since it was a 13-year-old system, and I have had issues in the past that I was ready to replace.  I didn’t feel any pressure from Billy attempting to sale me a new system.  He was ready for the less expensive repair.  Billy called home office and setup an appointment to replace the system on Monday morning.  The crew showed up Monday morning ready to work.  Everyone felt welcoming and treated my home like it was theirs.  I was very excited for the cold air Monday night.  I appreciate everyone at HACS that helped my family during this time of discomfort.",

After greeting each other and showing them where everything was, the technician got right to work.\nThe technician inspected the unit, found the problem, explained the problem and solution to the wife and I, fixed the problem the same day and the unit is now working better than what it was before.\n\nI was so grateful we finally found a company that is honest and true to their word.

VERY impressed with professionalism and expertise.

They were prompt in coming to inspect it and tried to see if it was fixable. Unfortunately it was on its last leg. Our return system was also not large enough for our home living in an older house. Not what any homeowner wants to hear, but Chad and Aaron made the whole process easy, from walking us through everything, showing us our options, and answering any questions I could come up with and some I didn’t even think of. They were professional, kind, prompt, and honest. Even when I had a question or concern in the two weeks after they were quick to respond and followed up to make sure everything was in working order. I cannot recommend them enough, if you have any heating and air issues I would call Bearden mechanical first.",

Steve was very helpful addressing our concerns and this has been the best experience we’ve had with HVAC work. They went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied, and Jeff the lead technician was one of the nicest people you will meet. He took extra time each visit to explain the work being done and why it was important. I highly recommend Casper and we will be using them as our HVAC partner going forward.",

I had a newborn and it was the dead of winter and we found out all our duct work needed to be replaced in our crawlspace so our heat would work properly. They came the next day and worked until long after dark and after hours because they didn’t want to displace us or leave us without heat because of our new baby. We were so touched that they worked so hard to do that for our family. They did great quality work for a reasonable price, we’re so professional and timely. We can feel a world of difference in the temperature of our home. They are coming back to check and clean our ductwork a couple of weeks later which is unlike most companies. We are so impressed and couldn’t recommend them more!",

Steve quickly diagnosed the problem, fixed the wiring, replaced capacitors and got us back under 70 degrees in an hour’s time. Absolutely thankful. Signed up for an annual maintenance plan immediately after seeing the work. Grateful. Thank you.",

        "text": "Charged $59 to come out and do an estimate and never provided the estimate. I wanted to have all the plumbing replaced and I wanted the work permitted, we had just purchased the house from an investor and wanted to make sure nothing was overlooked. They did not want to pull permits to do the work so they never even provided the estimate and management refused to take my calls to explain why or provide a refund. They just took my money and avoided my calls. I ended up having to dispute the charge with my bank which took a months for them to investigate. Not a trust worthy company at all.\nNO HOME OWNER WANTS NON-PERMITTED WORK DONE ON THEIR HOME!\nI wouldn’t deal with this company unless you make them pull permits and pay them only once work is done.",

Our tech arrived and saw that someone had already performed plumbing work on the home, and the work had been done incorrectly & not to code.  We informed the customer that we would have to obtain a plumbing permit from the city to perform the requested work.  The customer did not want us obtain a permit.  He asked if we did permit the job, if we would allow him to do other work under our permit.  We informed him that we would not pull a permit and allow others to do the work, because that is against the law.  This customer was told when he first called to schedule that there was a $59.00 diagnostic fee for the estimate.",

        "text": "Great service!  From the first telephone call for help, everything went well.  The technician,, Ryan , arrived as scheduled, carefully inspected the site and made a decision to solve the pipe leak which was previously repaired by another company.  As it turns out, the previous repair was flawed.  Ryan’s 20 years of experience and his communication skill helped me understand the fix.  It was now correctly  repaired.  Ryan’s support with the staff at Eagle not only phoned early on to confirm, sent a text that he was on the way with a map of his route.  Customer service I should rate at 5 stars.",

        "text": "I would NOT recommend Eagle Service for plumbing. They replaced a portion of our sewer pipe in our basement that we had been having clogging issues with. The new piping looks excellent and the problem seems to have been fixed. However... I had a couple of issues. They charged me an extra $150 for a 2nd visit that only took 10 minutes for him to confirm the issue (I believe this was refunded after I complained). And worst of all, he did not protect the work area and raw sewage dumped all over our washer and dryer, mop sink, basement walls, etc. I did not see this happen and it ended up being much worse than I thought. I asked him if he was going to clean up before he left, he didn't even sweep up the PVC dust from cutting the pipe. He asked me if I had a mop?? All he did was hose down the area and did NOT do a thorough job cleaning up the raw sewage or disinfecting the area. When I called the office to talk to a manager, they told me they have gotten calls before but that it was not standard for their crew to carry cleaning supplies on their trucks. They did not offer to send someone to clean up the mess. The Servpro quote was twice as much as the plumbing quote. I truly cannot believe they would leave someone's home in such a mess. It's a good thing it was in an unfinished basement!",

I was concerned about getting someone to check it out during this period of severe cold but Matt scheduled someone for first thing the next morning.  He diagnosed the issue (heat pump sensor was bad and not switching to emergency gas heat when required) and suggested an innovative solution that improved the heating situation at a much lower cost than replacing the sensor. I can always trust Dr. Cool to be fast, honest and fair. Highly recommend!",

I had even prefaced that I figured we needed a new A/C unit entirely, but Matt quickly and honestly concluded that it wasn’t the case. Instead, he diagnosed a number of issues that I had never even considered - from cleaning my A/C unit, to ductwork repair, to maximizing airflow through the house. That kind of honesty and expertise in the service industry is as rare as it is appreciated. And he saved me some serious cash. Now, I’m typing this up from the cool comfort of my optimized HVAC just hours after the guys finished up. 10/10 Dr Cool will be my go-to for HVAC issues and maintenance moving forward.",

        "text": "This past July, the upstairs AC went out at my daughter’s house. July in Alabama. And my 5 y/o Granddaughter is there.\n\nI asked on Nextdoor who to call. Matt Locklin at Dr. Cool was the answer. I called Matt on Friday morning. He answered despite being with his family. He offered to send his team out to install window AC’s in upstairs bedrooms to get them through the weekend. They were out first thing Monday morning. Handled the warranty stuff for the coil, picked it up, and installed it.\n\nThe AC went out again yesterday. Matt sent his guy out and quickly diagnosed the problem. It was actually an oversight by another company who installed the furnace and transition to the coil.\n\nDr. Cool corrected the other companies work, ran a full diagnostic and now all is well.\n\nI’ll call Matt and Dr. Cool again when we need AC service or repair!",

        "text": "UPDATE: Called Dr. Cool again because I once again got a quote from one of the bigger companies in town that seemed ridiculous - for the heater this time. They tried to scare me about carbon monoxide fumes and the parts were in short supply so that I would commit and move faster. I called Dr. Cool (which I should have just done to begin with but had a service package with this company for prior septic work) and he kindly debunked everything they had told me. I'm a single mom with no heat during our coldest winter. The other company preyed on that. Dr. Cool is very knowledgable, responsive and most importantly ETHICAL!!\n\nOld Review: Great work. Quick, efficient and saved me about $500. I used Dr. Cool as a second opinion to an estimate given by a big brand. Dr. Cool said their fix wasn't necessary, I let him move forward with his work and haven't had a problem with AC, since. I also liked that he was concerned about my kids' safety when he was working on the AC and told them not to go near the unit and what was dangerous. Great experience all around. My go-to AC person if I need him again.",

Temp outside at night was 67°F, instead of the usual 1289°F for late July. Impressed by Doctor Cool. Came out early in the morning exactly at the appointed time, personable and courteous servicemen, did their “thing,” no muss no fuss, reasonably priced. We will be making a service contract with them. They were recommended by the West Indian Springs Nextdoor group. I have been looking for a decent, reasonable, fair, and competent HVAC service for years. Oh, yes.. almost forgot: they did NOT try to upsell me on some pricey \"addition\" or new equipment. I will be spreading the word Doctor Cool. Thank you, guys.",

We had another company come out a few weeks before to service our unit and they tried to sell us a new duct system with no other options to improve our current system. Alex from Doctor Cool, however, found a filter that was totally clogged inside our system and after he removed it the system was working great. He also gave multiple suggestions of how they could improve the system.",

Most were swamped with appointments during this blistering start of summer, but I managed to get a hold of Dr Cool late yesterday evening.  He showed up right on time at 7am this morning.  He actually convinced me NOT to replace my unit!  Diagnosed the freon leak and when he left 1.5 hours later, it was like Easter morning... my AC was resurrected!  Very impressed with Matt ie Doctor Cool.  And yes the cartoon caricature he uses for his advertising looks just like him!  Kinda creepy but hilarious!  Thanks Doc!",

Last week the AC died and there was no possibility of resuscitation.  Dr Cool determined what was needed, provided a very fair quote, and expedited delivery of the equipment.  Today they did a complete change out on two systems AND fixed the problems in the ducts so we are consistently cool throughout the house!  Its miraculous!!

        "text": "Matt is super awesome!  My wife and I bought a 100 year old home in February of 2014 and as May rolled around, we realized that we had an AC issue.  We had a  brand new 2.5 ton unit but the problem was that it was pumping AC through old furnace vents.  That was fine for our downstairs but terrible for the 2nd floor.\n\nLong story short, Matt quickly diagnosed the problem and was able to install a new 1 ton unit for our second floor.  He cut new vents for each room on our second floor, installed an air distributor in our attic, and even fixed our attic fan in 2 days!  It was amazing and we've been nice and cool for the past few summers!",

        "text": "Birmingham Service Experts exceeded my expectations from start to finish! I had them out for a heating system tune-up, and I was genuinely impressed by their professionalism and attention to detail. The technician arrived right on time, was courteous, and took the time to thoroughly inspect everything.\n\nWhat stood out the most was how clearly they explained the condition of my system without pushing unnecessary repairs or upgrades. Honest, knowledgeable, and efficient—that’s hard to find these days. The service was smooth, pricing was fair, and they left the space clean.\n\nIf you’re in the Birmingham area and need reliable HVAC service, definitely check them out at 416 3rd St S. Highly recommend!",

        "text": "These individuals engage in fraudulent practices by posting paid reviews, indiscriminately hiring workers, and recommending unnecessary repairs, such as selling me a blower motor that was not required, solely to generate sales. Additionally, they levy charges for every subsequent issue that arises, seeking to extract an additional $99 from customers. I strongly advise seeking a reputable personal HVAC professional to avoid falling victim to their deceptive tactics and potential exploitation.",

Then, they quickly found a severe leak and showed it to me.\n\nAfter running through my options, they gave me a good quote to replace the heat pump and coil system -- better than anyone else that quoted me.\n\nThe next business day, Dominick and Marvin were here on time and performed the install quickly!  Now, we have a new unit, cold air, and I don't feel like I was sold something I didn't need and feel good about the price!\n\nIt means a lot these days to have a problem quickly fixed, and you leave the situation feeling good about it!

I called them on a Saturday morning because my air conditioner had stopped working, and they were able to send someone out to fix it within a few hours. The technician, Chris, was knowledgeable and courteous, and he diagnosed the problem quickly. He explained the issue and the repair options in a way that was easy to understand. The repair was done efficiently and effectively, and the price was very reasonable. I would highly recommend Nicks Heating and Cooling to anyone in need of HVAC services in the Birmingham area!",

They have kept my system in very good and reliable order.\nRecently, I had a problem with my clothes dryer. It became apparent that my vent was clogged. The original vent was plastic so I had Irwin come and replace it with metal. They came the next business day and completed the job in about four hours. I could not be more pleased with the job they did as well as the cost.",

Your an hour away and  still we were happy to assist with your problem, These mini splits communicate like a computer. All company's almost always have to call tech support for anything other than basic problems if its some sort of Commnication issue.  The tech did not just stand around waiting and investigated why the other ductless had not been affected.  Our tech while checking the other head as this is a multi ductless set up discovered the setting on the remote and since you were in the other room asked you to press the white button. As the problem was your indoor ductless did not give you a display on the screen. We do not build these units. We have nothing to do with the tech support. We defiantly have no control if they will even answer the phone or go to the restroom. We did not install the system. Weve never done work for you before this either. The tech was on time, clean cut, and since I know who he was he also was very courteous. Just like all my hand pick employees are. The rates we charge are not a hidden secret. If anything this 1 star review is not accurate. We didn't try to sell you anything you don't need. We didn't lie to you or give up as the others did. If anything, please understand we didnt turn the setting off on your mini split either. As this Service call was as simple as the wrong button had been pressed on the controller. We came to help sir.",

So I reviewed the info to determine the best coarse of action and called you personally. First time we proformed  work for you was in 2019. Replaced your unit on a Sunday. Yes a Sunday, myself personally with one of my guys. I DID NOT up charge you a overtime rate. Last fall you had a drain issue due to lack of maintenance and you agreed to a pm contract. The maintenance agreement is only $180 for twice a year. We’re not holding your money sir. For this INEXPENSIVE agreement it is required you pay up front at time we complete 1st of 2 trips.  You knew this upfront. It does not include a filter. Spaceguard type that was requested when installing the unit. It was already discussed that for this maintenance price we will not supply a filter. The tech took his time and did a GREAT job I noticed you didn’t complain about that. The truth of the matter if you are supposed to supply your own filter why is this a complaint? Teck had 3 hours on this job?!?! Including going to go get your filter that was not at the shop which is 5 minutes away. Little over a hour applied to just that. Because he had to go to Trussville because you hadn’t had the forethought to order a filter from Amazon as you know we don’t supply this as our agreement. I CALLED TODAY AND REMOVED the $50 from your BILL as a good faith of trying to maintain a decency of trying to make everyone happy. Already knowing the lady’s in the office were correct with not giving it to you. Had no idea you were going to give me a 1 star bad review. Honestly you should have been charged the $50 plus his labor time to fulfill your request of a filter. Sir. I hope you actually beating me out of $50 was worth it. There are plenty of other companies that will not meet your expectations also. I could not be happier you have removed me as a service provider for you with the facts I’ve gathered. Jeremy Irwin.",

On a recommendation, I called Plus One and Mark promptly visited my home and emailed me a written estimate for my insurance company. My insurance issued me a check within days of the event and I called Plus One to tell them to commence the work.  Within 10 days of my original call, my unit was replaced and I had the opportunity to meet three amazing young men who performed the work. Gadge, Luis, and Devin were so efficient and professional during their time in and out of my home. They were just downright nice and courteous. They worked constantly and they worked well with each other toward the same goal. This is a first class company and I intend to work with them for any future needs. Great job!",

A few hours later, expert technician Mark McClellan arrived, quickly assessed the situation, and determined that we needed a new condensate pump.\n\nMark’s kindness, attentiveness, and attention to detail stood out every step of the way. He not only solved the problem efficiently but also took the time to test everything thoroughly, ensuring our system was working properly before he left. His professionalism, expertise, and genuine joy in his work truly set him apart.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the quick response and top-notch service from Plus One, and especially for Mark—who is, without a doubt, the best of the best!

He ensured everything was done with excellence even if it meant undoing what was done or that he had to do it himself. We felt respected, honored, and blessed to have him overseeing our project. They cleaned up after themselves and just blew our expectations and mine are pretty high. The team was hard working and on some of the hottest days just soaked in sweat.

        "text": "We moved into this house 4 years ago (built in ‘90) and knew the HVAC units were old with some parts being from the original build. Our ductwork was full of mold and our electric bill was through the roof. We knew it was finally time to replace them and had four different companies come out and give estimates. We were the most impressed with Daniel at Plus One. They pointed out where our original install was designed improperly and completely redid both our upstairs and downstairs systems including all new duct work. We also felt like their pricing was more reasonable than some other companies we received quotes from.\n\nThe new systems are very nice and we now have a dual fuel heat pump for both floors of the house. Gadge and Myles did most of the install work and we couldn’t have been happier with their work. They did a great install and were very professional and hardworking whenever they were here.\n\nIf you are looking for a company and are not sure who to choose because every company is giving you different answers on what your home needs I recommend going with Plus One. They take a scientific approach to ensuring all of your ductwork is sized correctly for proper airflow. They installed dampers and adjusted the airflow in each room to meet the needs of the space. Most of this stuff other companies didn’t offer to do.\n\nThe new system works more efficiently and is quieter than our old system. We also had the AprilAire whole home air cleaner installed to help with our allergies. The ductwork was really well done and passed pressure testing with flying colors. Our old ductwork was really leaky and had so many holes in it. This new ductwork is made from sheet metal wrapped in insulation and will last for decades.\n\nThey customized the install to meet our home’s specific needs and didn’t insist on one size fits all. We will continue to use Plus One to service our new systems for life. We had a great experience with everyone we dealt with at Plus One. They definitely earned a five star review.",

Infinity has exceeded our expectations and went above and beyond for us.  Very quick to respond and take care of the issues with your heating and air.  Doug seems interested in fixing the issue instead of just selling a new system which I appreciate.  Call them,  you will not regret it.",

        "text": "Awesome experience!  This is an honest, family-run business.  They responded quickly to my call.  Even though I had a 23 year old unit, the technician worked to repair the system.  He did not make me feel that the unit must be replaced immediately.  I appreciated his attempts, but knew the unit was on its way out.  When the unit finally gave out again, I made the decision to replace the unit.  Infinity gave me an extremely reasonable and competitive quote.  They also offered excellent, manageable financing with a well known institution.\nThe unit replacement process was  completed in one day with little inconvenience to me.  The technicians were neat, efficient, professional & friendly.  After the unit was replaced I had a few questions, and the company owner was quick to come by my home and address the situation.  He left me with a feeling of confidence that he guaranteed their work and the system installed.\nInfinity Air Solutions gave my home cool air again, coming from a new, beautiful Trane unit along with the education of its operations.  (Yes, it was beautiful to me, after spending two weeks in this summer's 100 degree weather.)  They also left me with the feeling that they would be there if I had any future needs.  I will be calling them in the future for regular maintenance on my new unit.\nI highly recommend Infinity Air Solutions, Heating & Air Conditioning.\nJenny McCune\nBluff Park, Hoover, AL",

Pricing was middle of the road (some bids higher, some lower), but this outfit sent out a knowledgeable young man who answered our questions, and showed up when he said he would, to remove the old system and install the new one, which has worked flawlessly since. We moved here (thanks to my former employer) from California, so the climate change was rather spectacular, from an area with much dryer weather to the typical heat and humidity one finds in this part of the world. We do seem to be saving somewhat on power usage, but will not really know until a complete set of seasons has passed. All in all, dealing with Infinity Air was a good experience.",

I called Freedom HVAC as it had the best reviews. We had a technician come over and told us that we would have to spend in excess of 2k to repair or 5k to change the system. Just for a second opinion, I called infinity solutions. We had Doug (technician) come over and gave us the most honest opinion and fixed our AC for less than $300. Please do not go to freedom HVAC in Bessemer as they are into the business of ripping people off. I would like to recommend Infinity to anyone in need of HVAC service and repair.",

He (owner) was indeed here within the hour and turns out the unit only needed a smart part replaced. He replaced and our unit has been cooling since.

Daniel was great at educating me on what I needed and why.  He worked very hard to give me many options at different prices to resolve my issue.  Ultimately, it turned out the entire duct system in our house needed to be replaced.  Great guys,  even better work.  They worked 7-7 basically two days in a row and, upon request, came back for a third day to touch up a few things I pointed out.

We had also noticed hot and cool spots on the  upstairs floor serviced by the system. Daniel conducted a thorough inspection of the old system and our duct work, then provided a clear explanation of the various issues followed by highly detailed estimates for replacing the old system. He patiently answered myriad questions, including a couple that required a bit of research. He provided a second set of estimates for a different system to help us stay within budget. He made sure replacements were Energy Star and offered excellent warranties and financing w/Greensky. He was able to schedule the installation when we needed it and his team were on time, professional, and cleaned up when they were finished! Communication with the office staff was also professional and prompt. Daniel and the others at TempPro earned our trust and we will be hiring them for biannual maintenance and any future HVAC repairs/installations. A-plus on BBB and glowing reviews of Daniel on Google are well-deserved.",

One time they serviced a unit for one of my daughters and had her back up and running in no time and for a very reasonable price. Another time my other daughter had a unit that was not repairable and they worked with her to get a new unit at a vary fair price and did the work quickly and efficiently. Not once did they try to sell something more than what was needed and both have been working great since then. They are definitely my go to people for anything related to to AC or Heat issues. You can trust what they say and have peace of mind knowing you aren’t getting taken advantage of. I highly encourage everyone to give them a call for any AC or Heat work you may need.",

        "text": "After getting several quotes I decided to use TemperaturePro to replace the aging HVAC unit in my condo. Three installers arrived and did, what I would consider, a very good job on replacing both the inside air handler and the outside condenser unit. They made several changes on the fly so the install would look right. They even put insulation on a pipe so it wouldn't drip on the floor since it wasn't over the drain pan. While TemperaturePro wasn't the cheapest quote, I did get the most for my dollar spent. I even received a call from the home office that another person is going to come out for a final review of the install. That's real customer service.",

The team I dealt with were great at communicating the work involved with frequent updates and before, during and after pictures. The work was completed in a timely manner and priced very fair. We are required to three bid projects such as these and Temperature  Pro was the best over all hands down. Would use again in the future.

He phoned me to tell me the time he would be arriving and was prompt. He thoroughly investigated the nature of my AC problem. While doing so, he was called away for an emergency but promised to come right back when he was done. And he did. And guess what? He called to tell me he was on his way back. He diagnosed and repaired the AC issue and explained every aspect of the repair. Russell is a great communicator and a highly skilled tradesman. I would hire again and again.",

        "text": "Best AC business that I've ever dealt with.  We noticed that the upstairs AC was suddenly not cooling properly on a Sunday afternoon. Russell with Affordable Heating and Air called me early Monday morning and was quickly here to diagnose the issues with the unit.  I needed a new fan motor, and I expected that it would take several days for the part to arrive and be installed.  However, Russell was back the following morning and had us back up and running in a matter of minutes.  Great AC service, great customer service, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else.",

        "text": "PLEASE READ before you use this company. We originally were sent Affordable Heating and Air through a claim with Old Republic in 2021. They came out and fixed what was needed and we had a good experience. We flip and rent houses and have had multiple units replaced through Old Republic through Affordable Heating and Air. They told us to contact their nephew Nate (their technician) for our needs and we have for years. In Dec 2023, Nate quoted us a unit and we sent him money for it. Weeks went by without installation and then he said he needed more money for an upgrade of which we sent. $5,200 WAS STOLEN FROM US. When I say stole, he literally texted us and told us he USED OUR MONEY FOR CHILD SUPPORT AND WILL PAY US BACK. I have the texts. It’s insane. But what is more insane is that his family and owners would let a long time customer be robbed and not make us whole. It tells you everything you need to know about how they run a business.\n\nWe contacted his aunt who is the owner of the company and even after hearing everything, she offered for us to pay $4k MORE at supposed cost to “make it right”. We originally said no that we wanted our unit for the price agreed upon and we wouldn’t be outlaying any more money until it was installed. Two days later once we realized we just needed to get it done, we call back and say fine, we will pay the money and just lose out on the rest since you won’t take responsibility for your employee/nephew that STOLE FROM US. At that point she then said that they no longer were offering a discount and basically told us to fly a kite. If you do use them, do not outlay any money until the unit is installed. I hope Old Republic will end their contract with them so nobody else is a victim like we were.\n\nI took this review down originally because after posting it, the owner Russell called me to tell me that he really would fix it and he was sorry that there was a miscommunication. We talked for 30 minutes and I agreed to take it down. After a week and a half has gone by and he refuses to answer or return my call, I have no choice but to put it back up. I am the only victim here and have still not received my $5,200 back that was stolen from me. These people are thieves and liars. I cannot believe they think it is okay to conduct their business this way. My sister also paid them $2,000 for work that we can also not get a call back on. Do not associate with this company. The Alabaster inspector says he will be reporting them to the state board.",

My appointment was scheduled for Friday and the technician called and stated it was raining ( not sure what rain has to do with an inside unit) and needed to reschedule that next morning between 9-10. Technician Nathaniel Brooks was a complete no show. After rearranging my entire day and LEAVING A VOICE-MAIL this guy never calls back to say anything. I call Monday morning and the supervisor, by the way was very helpful, stated Mr. Brooks FORGOT TO PUT ME ON THE SCHEDULE....HOW!? Even With that being the case I left a voice message on his phone THAT MORNING! So you don't check your phone all day..OK\nMore frustration added to a more frustrating situation.

        "text": "Affordable Heating and Air was sent to my house as part of American Home Shield Home Warranty program. The technician NEVER put a gauge on the condensing unit to check refrigerant levels. Instead he told me Ahs required him to put Freon in the unit; although, it leaks the refrigerant out, and he said it would cost $1432.00 out of my pocket. He told me what a horrible company Ahs is, and while I agree, he attempted to price gouge me at a $199.00 per pound, I’ve been paying $50.00 per pound. He never asked if I wanted him to, but rather stated, “I know you don’t want me to do this and I don’t blame you, if it was mine, I wouldn’t do it either. I’ll send in the report telling them what I found.” He sent in the report and stated customer refused to allow him to add refrigerant. He did not have to add 8 lbs of refrigerant to test the system, but this was his way of making a quick buck thinking unsuspecting customers will not know. I would highly recommend you FIND\nANOTHER COMPANY to do your hvac work. The audacity of attempting to charge $200 per lb is ignorant at best and is the definition of a scam artist at worst. The lies to me and deceptive trade practices by never putting a gauge on the equipment, and stating I refused is repugnant. DO NOT USE these folks, and never buy a home warranty from American Home Shield, I’m wondering now if they are colluding to unsuspecting customers?",

        "text": "I have had a very bad experience with Affordable Care Heating and Air. My home warranty gave them my claim to fix my heating and air in November, that was 3 weeks ago.  They order a part for heating and picked the part up last Wednesday. The people said they would be giving me a call to put the part in, the part is the condenser part on the heater., they picked the part up last Wednesday. The people said they would be giving me a call to put the part in, so I waited to receive a call back.  I didn't receive a call back.  Home Warranty said that Affordable Care Heating and Air would be giving me a call back.  They first came to put the blower in the heating unit upstairs at the beginning of November. Instead of fixing the downstairs heating, they closed the case.  So I am left sitting in the freezing cold. I called the company, they were supposed to fix the claim. They had to order the parts. The part came Wednesday before Thanksgiving. They said they would put the part on Monday and give me a call. I received no call, no txt, no nothing. I call back to the company to see when they were putting the part in. Owner of Affordable Care company called said they withdraw claim because I have been harassing them. Now I have to start the procedure all over because the women lied on me. I never harassed anyone. I only called the company one time to see when they would be fixing my heating unit.  Not only that, but I am still cold and don't have any heat. Furthermore, I feel like I have been lied on by the company. I do not recommend anyone do business with this company. If she lies on me, who else will she lie on. I'm freezing with no heat because of a lie she told just to get out of fixing my heating unit.",

He was advised he will get a 30 minute courtesy call which never happened. About 4pm he continued to call and AHS continued to call and didn't get an answer. About 8pm I got a text after I left a voicemail, letting them know how unprofessional they are. You think they would know that the courteous thing to do is to call a let your customers know your not coming or running late. They text and asked could they schedule us for first thing Saturday morning which we agreed. First thing Saturday morning turned into 1pm Saturday afternoon. I would NOT recommend them to anyone, the customer service and overall service is very poor and so unprofessional. The technician didn't have a clue what he was doing, they are ripping people off and just getting money to get contract work. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME‼️",

        "text": "Old Republic Home Protection assigned my HVAC claim to Affordable Heating & Air LLC in Birmingham.First tech(so called) that came quickly diagnosed a Freon leak and with no attempt to locate leak was going to inject a “stop leak” product. I refused to let him do that. The second person to come out was their so called leak specialist. He just as quickly diagnosed that the evaporator coil was leaking. He determined this without looking in the air handler. What a joke. Prior to the second person coming out, I paid a local HVAC company to come out and their Technician did a thorough inspection and located the leak in the accumulator as evidenced by oil residue and Freon leak detector. I would not use Affordable at any price nor a home warranty company that contracts with them. Affordable’s office person, Tanya, was very friendly and professional.",

        "ownerResponse": "Hi! I am sorry to hear you are dissatisfied with your experience using Trinity for your water leak repair. Our charges are very similar to those of the competition and in many cases, lower, but are most definitely in line with industry standards. We do charge a standard vehicle charge of $50 for normal wear and tear items related to the vehicle, and having the truck stocked with items for various repairs, and then travel time to the location since we do have to pay our technicians for that time associated with your individual job. Again, both of these are standard industry practices and are in line with other service providers of the same nature. \n\nUnfortunately with water leaks behind a wall, we do have to usually make several holes in the wall in our efforts to identify the leak. While this is not ideal for the homeowner, it isn't possible to know where a leak behind a wall is without the investigative processes, nor can it be repaired without making access holes once it is identified. We do, however, offer sheetrock services as an additional convenience to expedite the wall repairs for our clients.",

Their tech told me I had a severe problem with bacteria in the ductwork in my attic and that it would cost about $5k to rectify.  Doug King came out and checked out my attic/ductwork and told me I do not have any such problem, that my ductwork is very clean.  He even took/gave me pictures that I could show the other HVAC company to report their tech.  He was friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, and saved me from being taken advantage of by another company.  Doug King rocks!  I will be using Trinity Contractors for future HVAC service as they earned my trust.",

The tech was very friendly and somewhat helpful as to a possible solution. He was supposed to get with his supervisor and work up a quote to do the job. I didn't hear back from anyone for almost 2 weeks and that was only because I kept having to call to talk to someone until I finally lost my patience and made a scene on the phone with the poor girl who answered. The guy finally called me back apologized for not calling me back and said it was because they were coming up with a solution...( to which I thought we already had). We talked and came up with another solution and I asked for a price for that.... again haven't heard from him until I had to call.... still haven't gotten a quote!!!!! I am a very unhappy customer!!!

It is now a month later my AC went out again. I put a claim in and they did a recall so he could come back out again to fix the issue. It was dispatched to him early Thursday morning but I didn’t hear from him until Friday morning at 8. He said he would be back out to fix it and would call me around 10. I never received a phone call. I called him but no answer and I left a voicemail. I tried calling 30 minutes later. Phone ring immediately was sent to voicemail. I then text him and told him that it is 90 degrees outside so it’s even hotter inside the house. I had just brought my mom home from being in the hospital for 20 days due to finding out she has cancer so the last thing I need her to be uncomfortable in this way. I saying all this to say that a company should never conduct business this way by not acknowledging a conversation. This company needs to be banned from all warranty companies because this is unacceptable. So please who ever that is about to use this guy, DON’T!!!!! Poor way of conducting business.",

        "text": "All I can say is avoid at all cost. Do not allow the home warranty company to assign A&E as you provider. They are hard to communicate with, don’t answer calls, sometimes will text, and arrive hours late for the appointment time if they arrive at all. They promise to call back but never do and you will spend hours trying to contact them. They left us without AC for two weeks and then put a hard start kit in to try to get the unit going until a compressor came in. Two weeks of 90 plus temps in my house when it could have been done on the first day. My compressor was never installed (second week of July now) so I had to pay another service fee to have another company fix my AC which by the way was NOT the compressor. I now have working AC after 20 minutes of another company fixing my AC that had been down since May.",

If you have to work with them through the HWA, go ahead and request service from a different company so your time isn't wasted. I've been without heat for 14 days. I have a family including two kids under 3 and am at my absolute wits' end. I've had to spend the holidays at my mother's house, mother-in-law's and anywhere else we can find a bed because these buffoons can't do their job. It's obvious that they don't want to do their job and have no desire to help customers. They've played the blame game, not shown up to at least FOUR appointments after they've called me saying they were on their way and haven't communicated ANYTHING to me after multiple issues with this claim. They've also sent 4 different people out each time I've needed assistance who have all given 4 explanations as to what our \"problem\" is. You'd think that a business would at least have the wherewithal and internal communication skills to talk about an issue so they can problem solve it, right? THINK AGAIN! There is no logic. There is no rhyme or reason and there certainly is NO customer service. Look somewhere else.",

        "text": "Worst customer service! After 5 weeks of no a/c, we decided to use another company that has a contract with our home warranty company and start our entire process over. He does not communicate well at all and does not answer his phone. He lied to the warranty company and said he talked to us when he clearly did not. We were told that we could not switch contractors during this time of the process but after 5 weeks and plenty of complaining, we finally have a company that actually cares and wants to help us. We now have air conditioning after 6 weeks of being without thanks to another company- they had it fixed within a week. I would highly recommend using a different heating and cooling company if you want it done in a timely manner.",

First off I have to call my home warranty 3 times before the owner would call me and even set up a appointment. I call on a Wednesday and get a service order and they didn't show up until Friday....gave me a 4:30p appointment they didn't show up til 6:00p. Then the technician tried to get a extra $75.00 out of me on something that was covered in my service agreement. And my A/C unit is still not fix. Don't recommend this so call company to anyone.....There worthless.!!",

Not only did he fix the issue that my unit was having, he also went above and beyond to ensure that every other part of my unit was working properly.

The second time (yesterday), he checked our HVAC systems out. He pointed out some items to watch. When I mentioned a hard rain caused the flu pipe going through the roof, to leak once recently. He went up on my steep roof and called around the pipe and roof penetration as well as around the cap. He did not charge got me that!  My previous HVAC people kept promising to get someone to put a new cap on but I finally found someone to replace the cap and had no problems until recently.",

He worked clean, was very accommodating to my family and respected my home every step of the way.\n\nHe's always got a good attitude and I don't think anyone out there can do better prices for the quality of work you get.\n\nIf you needed a sign, this is your guy.

        "text": "Brandon at Full Force is very professional and trust worthy. We had a very bad experience with a install of a new unit with a small local HVAC company that needed repairs within one year. Brandon came out resolved the issues going over and beyond without bashing the other company after hearing our story.  We ended up needing another old unit replaced and went with Brandon after the great service on our first series of calls. Brandon had very competitive pricing and takes pride in his work. He is also very knowledgeable in diagnosing and trouble shooting issues. We have been taken to the cleaners with other HVAC companies and very thankful we found Brandon with Full Force. I know enough about HVAC systems to know when someone is giving us the run around as Brandon was very thorough in explaining our issues with different options and resolutions. I also ended up over paying Brandon and he caught it while doing our invoice. Brandon called explained what he found and personally delivered the difference of the overpayment. Brandon also has reached out to follow up on how the units are running after any work has been completed. I can’t say enough of Brandon’s workmanship, professionalism and ethics. We would highly recommend Brandon and Full Force to all of our family and friends.",

The previous AC technician told me that the compressor and several other components weren’t working, which had me worried about a major repair expense. But when Hamza from Dr. Comfort came over, he did a thorough diagnosis and figured out exactly what was going on. He saved me a lot of money by identifying the real issue, which wasn’t as serious as I’d initially thought. Hamza is the best—knowledgeable, honest, and professional.

I recommend him and his company for any HVAC needs. He came out in the middle of a flood/tornado because he told me he would come that day and he did!\n\nThis is very hard to find. Prices are comparable but very reasonable. They don’t push a bunch of products on you. My air conditioner was up and running within 30 minutes & there haven’t been any problems since.

He is extremely detailed in his explanations and documentation of any problems, and does not try to sell unnecessary products. He is very ethical in his dealings with customers. People like him don’t come along very often. His assistant Jose is also very nice, courteous, and knowledgeable. There are other good companies I’m sure, but this company operates on a different level from any I’ve ever known. FIVE STARS ALL AROUND!!!\nD. Dean",

        "text": "My husband and I purchased a Mitsubishi Mini Split from Alabama Cooling and Heating November 01, 2024. The installation crew was amazing. They removed and disposed of the old unit and installed the new unit very quickly. They cleaned up all debris. They were very professional. My complaint is after the installation. I realized they didn't leave a bill of sales or the owners manual, warranty info etc. I called the office and spoke with Kenzy. She said she will get everything from the crew and mail it the following morning. A week passed and no paperwork. I have made numerous calls and sent many emails with no response. I did receive 2 email replies from Kenzy saying everything was in the mail. And when we didn't receive the paperwork I emailed again and called her out on the lies. She told me to go online and print out a manual. I said no! I want the original manual and paperwork that came with the unit and we paid for. She sent another email saying they were working with Mitsubishi to get another manual. What happened to the original? We did get a receipt on November 12th. It's now March 20, 2025 and still no paperwork. If you do business with this company make sure you get all your paperwork the day of service or you'll never get it. I have no issues with the crew just the lack of customer service.",

My husband tinkered with it a little cause that's just what men do and then we decided its was time to make the call. We new someone that actually works there but weve never had to deal with this before so it just made sense to call them. Im so glad we did! I have NEVER had any kind of technician show up that quick. Thank Jesus it wasnt a new unit but we didn't freeze! He fixed it, hung around for a min to make sure it was running properly, asked us if there was anything more they could do for us an it was done. We will always go back if we need too and if someone asks we will tell them. Wonderful people! Call them!",

When the technician checked the compressor the readings he gathered were incorrect. While we could have installed a new compressor the indoor coil would have needed to be replaced as well to work with the new refrigerant which is why we informed you guys it would make more sense to replace the system. Putting $500 or more into a system that age in our opinion is a waste of money, but you are entitled to do what you see fit with your system which is why we always encourage getting a second opinion I’m glad that they got the system up and running.",

        "text": "We decided it was time to have our AC units serviced, so I reached out to Cool Temp Air at the recommendation of a friend. I was able to set up the appointment via text (within 24 hours of my text!) and got a call the morning of to let me know they were on the way. Both units at our house are older, but rather than trying to sell me something I don't need today, Ron, the technician, was able to keep things up and running and it didn't break the bank. He helped educate me on different parts of the unit and what to do when it is time to finally get a whole new unit (and hopefully how to avoid needing two at the same time!) At no time did I feel like he was trying to sell me on anything I didn't need. He was professional and courteous. We will definitely be calling them for our annual service as well as for anything that comes up in between!",

Thank you so much for such a great review, and for taking the time to let more people in the Birmingham metro area know about 1st Choice Heating and Cooling. \n\nWe wanna give you a 5⭐️ review and a shoutout right here, too!  \n\n5⭐️- You offered to give up your parking spot so the technician could park there and not have to walk a long way carrying his tools and ladder. People aren’t that thoughtful anymore, and it deserves a tip of the hat when someone is. 🎩 \n\nShout out- To anyone reading this reply, it wasn’t very hard to clean Mary’s system. She does a great job on her own and changes her filters regularly. It was pretty much spotless when we got there. We don’t find them like that very often.",

He thoroughly accessed the issues causing problems and Eric went and checked the other unit. Eric was great too.  Together they provided incomparable service.  In The Alabama heat, we was at 80+ degrees in the house. To be honest it was cooler outside.  Francisco got everything fixed and Sonny and his wife (the owner) are a blessing,  they made sure we could afford the services, they are truly a beautiful team.  I am forever grateful!!! The prices,  the service,  the guarantees are the best I've seen.  Thank you so much First Choice Heating and Cooling!",

Francisco and Wyatt worked through a thunderstorm and until after 900 pm until they had my new system working and cooling my home.

        "text": "We have been screwed over before by HVAC companies and as a result, when our AC went out a few weeks ago we decided to get several companies’ opinions before letting anyone fix it. Of the 3 companies that came out, it was very easy to make our decision and go with First Choice. Sonny (the owner) seems like a great guy who genuinely cares about both his customers & his employees, and wants to run an honest business. He even lent us an air cooler to help keep our house cool while they were working on it. They were able to replace our AC system & furnace quickly & at a fair price, and offered 0% financing options. They also furnished us with an 10 year parts & labor warranty on our new system!  Eric, Francisco, & Wyatt were our techs and they were friendly, professional, and did quality work.\nWe highly recommend this company!",

        "ownerResponse": "Michelle, Jacob, and Milo! THIS is exactly why we started 1st Choice. I have witnessed some horrible scenarios in my time in the HVAC business in the Birmingham Metro area. It makes it hard for people to trust any HVAC company. We aim to change that...one household at a time. Because, we are passionate about the heating and cooling trade, and we feel as though we can bless a lot of people in this industry. I hope you love that new Dual Fuel Heat Pump and Gas A/C and Furnace. You got the best of both worlds, and it's 17 SEER so I can't wait to see your energy bill savings. \n\nThat Google Nest was a nice addition to the package, too. It will alert us if your system needs attention. So mix that with the fact that everything is under warranty for a decade, and that means you can be worry free when it comes to the heating and cooling of your place. Also, I know you might be moving during the next decade, and the new homeowners will be happy to hear that the warranty is transferrable to them.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to write this review. Especially since you are navigating the difficult time of losing a loved one. We appreciate the shout out, and we are right around the corner if you ever need anything.",

It’s a significant contribution to our mission of guiding people away from less reputable HVAC services in the region—those lacking in trustworthiness, expertise, and courtesy.\nRest assured, we’ve got you covered for all your heating and cooling needs, so you don't have to worry about anything pertaining to your heating and air conditioning anymore. We are also pretty good light bulb changers, trash taker outers, and porch conversationists...if you have a need for anything in those areas every now and then. 😁\nWishing you a wonderful day, and our heartfelt thanks once more 🙏",

From the moment they answered the phone, their professionalism was evident. They went above and beyond, respecting my home by wearing foot covers and ensuring a tidy work environment. Isaish, in particular, stood out with his impressive knowledge and courteous demeanor. In an industry where customer satisfaction seems to be dwindling, 3D Service Guys have gained a loyal customer in me. Thanks to Isaish for representing your company with such excellence! Highly recommended.",

Rick is the epitome of professionalism and reassurance. He is the reason I am giving 5 stars. He and his team spent the whole day fixing the other guy's mistakes.

Chris and crew did an outstanding job of installing our system and the crew that did the duct cleaning was thorough and professional.

The technicians were super thorough and made sure to look over everything, even beyond the obvious problems.\n\nI was happy with the technicians work, but I was pretty taken aback when the invoice came. They were very upfront about the diagnosis/trouble shooting fee, however the cost of the labor/parts for the repairs wasn't discussed until the bill came. Had I known they were going to charge $400 in labor to change my 2 overflow switches, I would have just paid for the diagnosis and spent the 10 minutes to do it myself.",

        "text": "Cannot say enough good things about Bo Jiffy Heating and Air. We have had numerous problems with our HVAC unit since moving into our Pelham home 3 years ago. Today, I called our home warranty company as we had a problem that another company tried to fix 35 days ago. Our unit would shut off which made the home very cold (or hot) depending on the season, and sometimes unlivable. Bo Jiffy came out within 4 hours to fix our problem and ensure we didn’t freeze as the temperature plummets into the mid to low 30s tonight. They were beyond accommodating and understanding. I will be requesting Bo Jiffy any time I call my home warranty company for HVAC repairs in the future. Do yourself a favor and seek these guys out. You cannot go wrong.",

        "text": "So thankful for Bo Jiffy Heating & Air. We filed a claim through our home warranty, First American, and it was assigned to a different contractor. This is the third company who had worked on it in less than a year, all assigned through FA. After going without ac for three months with two adults, three kids, and two dogs in our home we pushed for them to assign a different contractor. On a Thursday, after fighting with FA and the other contractor (Elite Air) over missing/wrong parts, FA finally assigned our claim to Bo Jiffy. He came out the next morning and we had ac within a few hours. He showed me exactly what was wrong, recharged the unit, and we have been good to go since! Highly, highly recommended!",

        "text": "I wish I could give them ten stars because they deserve every one.  Bo Jiffy is our heat and cooling company from now on warranty or no. 4 different companies  were sent out. The first tech couldn't figure it out, the second tech rigged it up to run on heat strips which meant the air would never work, the third guy said that we needed a new system that of course the warranty company would not cover. Robert from Bo Jiffy was the charm. He was thorough and checked the system back and forth multiple times. Even once he had everything up and running he ran the air tested it then the heat and tested it then the air again and then the heat again. So far so good.  He was quick professional and best of all he actually fixed the issue. Robert kept us informed about his location so we were not waiting all day wondering when he would show up. I can't sing their praises enough. This is one very satisfied customer.\n\nI am so impressed. I was super leery  of dealing with another technician because the people that our warranty company has been sending out have been quite awful. He restored my  faith in the warranty company and repair people all of them aren't awful money grubbing liars even though most of them seem to be. Rest assured they will be thorough and take care of you. If you have choice warranty I suggest you cut out the headache and specifically ask for this company. They are worth the wait if there is one. Our work order was put in on Saturday they were out here  on Monday.\n\nI love to have reasons to compliment a company and they gave me plenty.",

They were sent out through our home warranty 4 different times due to our unit never being fixed, it would work for a day or two then stop again and be 88-94 degrees in our home. Now, we have water damage as well and he poured the WRONG FREON and also overloaded it. We are now having to buy an entire new system out of pocket due to our home warranty sending companies like this out and fix water damage out of our pocket! Also, they are completely unprofessional. For example, the owner of this branch was the technician as well that came out and he proceeded to take his shirt off and “work” while there was only a young woman in the house!! He was not the fittest either, very disturbing. Also, he new we have a small child too and he wouldn’t come out until it was convenient for him and complained about it every time we had to call to set up an appointment AGAIN because he lived 45 minutes away. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! (I don’t want to give them a star but it wouldn’t let me post this unless I did.)",

        "text": "My AC unit had been performing quite poorly in recent weeks, and after looking into various service providers around Birmingham, I decided to call BoJIFFY. I could not be more satisfied with the service Bo provided! Bo answered my phone call after only 2 rings at 7:30 AM, and was able to diagnose the issue with near certainty. I asked if Bo could arrive to work on my AC at noon, and he arrived at 11:59. Sometimes my watch runs a little slow, so he likely arrived at exactly 12:00. I would highly recommend BoJIFFY to anyone in need of air conditioning service – Bo is a top-notch professional!",

If you are searching for a honest, reasonable, professional, and on time mechanical wizard, use this company!  I would have given Mason and Schoettlin Mechanical Contractors a 10+ if they had this rating.  I have been through the big HVAC companies in town.  Absolutely NO comparison to Schoettlin in my humble opinion.  These folks are my go-to mechanical pros from now on!!!",

My unit was 25 years old so it was a better choice money and equipment wise to replace. This was at 6:00pm in the evening at 8:00am the next morning he showed back up with a new unit and had it installed by lunch. They did an excellent job on the install. If I or my friends need any refrigeration needs I will refer them to Comfort Technology. They do an awesome job. I can not say enough good things about this company.",

We loved working with you but hate that you left a bad review on us not the actual company that did you wrong. I hate that we had to turn down your last service request but you still have an outstanding balance that we have yet to receive and until we get payment we cannot do any further work. I hope you have a wonderful evening and find a good service company for your future issues.",

He checked everything, explained the possibilities and options, ultimately we decided to replace it.   He brought us a comfort proposal and answered all our questions about the different units.   We decided on one and made arrangements to have it installed on Wednesday.                           June 7th Triston and Christian arrived right on time and got straight to work.  They worked very hard getting the new unit installed, they even cleaned up their work area.   Absolutely pleased with all of the work, both were very personable and professional.  Will certainly be recommending Triston and Christian and Grissom.  Thank you Grissom Service Company!!!!",

They had a man at our house within the hour and by noon, the AC was working again just fine. That included time they had to take to go out and get a replacement part. Tristan, the service tech, was very friendly and obviously takes his job seriously. Our unit is 16 years old and many other companies would have seized on that to try and sell me a new unit. While they did mention that my unit has a limited life remaining, they told me it is working fine right now. There was no high pressure sales pitch, just good quality service.

        "text": "UPDATE:\nSo I got a call from Grissom Brother's on yesterday. The customer service rep expressed the company's concern with my customer service experience. Apparently I was overcharged. I should not have been charged the diagnostic fee once I accepted service. She also explained that I received the best product for my situation and that the price was on par with receiving quality product and labor. She surprisingly rectified the situation by giving me a huge discount for my trouble instead of just refunding the diagnostic fee. I really appreciated that! 😊\n\nI must say, superior customer service, as I received from Grissom Brother's on yesterday is priceless! Based on their integrity alone,  I'd not only highly recommend them but use them again.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nSo I just had the capacitor on my AC unit fixed. It took the guy at most 15 minutes to fix. The cost was about $355 plus the $85 diagnostic fee. This is a bit pricy for not even 30 minutes worth of work with a part that is not that expensive. Online research revealed that an appropriate price for this work is between $100 and $150, if you choose not to do it yourself. And if that's not enough, it's extra to use a credit card. Wow!!!\n\nI guess I shouldn't have been trying to get the air fixed so fast and through the warranty; which didn't help because the part wasn't even covered. And since it was going to cost me $85 anyway, I went ahead with the service...big mistake 😕. I mean, the dude showed me a price list on his phone; I should have known something since he didn't have an actual one to show me...smh. This is the first time reviews let me down. One of their customers gets an $11,000 quote from a competitor but the problem is fixed for less than $100 by them. Guess that wasn't a real review \"fake news\". 🤔🤨🙄☹️😒\n\nOn a positive note, although the technician spelled my name completely wrong on the invoice, he was nice, fast talking and moving but nice.",

        "text": "When it was time to replace our HVAC and hot water heater the first quote we received (from another company) seemed unreasonably high. A neighbor highly recommended getting a quote from AGA HVAC  Services as they replaced the same systems for her the previous year.\n\nAGA provided a detailed quote, very competitive pricing, and was happy to answer ALL of our questions. Thankfully, they were able to coordinate the install of both systems to take place on the same day. The entire team was professional, friendly, and did a great job.  Following the install, they were very helpful (and patient) in providing an A-Z overview of the new Nest smart thermostat. They also completed the online owner’s registration for the HVAC system which extended our warranty another 5 years.\n\nPrior to leaving, the owner provided his cell number with instructions to call if we had any follow-up questions regarding the new smart thermostat rather than referring us to the owner’s manual. A week following the installation, the owner followed up to see if we had any questions or issues. This level of customer support is MUCH appreciated!\n\nI would definitely recommend AGA HVAC Services to others, and we will call on them again for any future HVAC and/or plumbing needs.",

        "text": "Horrible experience.  I called about a clogged kitchen sink and had a 1430 appointment scheduled for Friday. I called 30-45 minutes after the appointment because the repairman had not shown up or called.  He ended up being over 3 hours late.  He spent a little over an hour snaking and plunging the sink (both things that I told him I had been doing repeatedly the last 24-48 hours). He didn’t have anything fixed, charged $175 and we scheduled another appointment for Sunday at 0700.  This time he was over 4 hours late. He spent the first hour and a half doing the exact same two things he did on Friday that didn’t work.  He then needlessly cut the pipe under the sink that he had already disconnected in order to snake it and had to go get materials to repair it.  He was gone for an hour.  He repaired it after coming back and then went into the attic to try and snake the clog from another direction.  He said he was going to use a drain bladder to try and clear the clog and would need a 100’ hose, which I had and offered.  He instead left again for well over an hour.  He came back with a brand-new garden hose and bladder and had the clog cleared in about 15 minutes.  I was charged another $750 because he was there for “5 hours”.  This job could have been completed in a fraction of the time, but I guess when you’re charging by the hour, even the hours you aren’t actually at my home, you take your sweet time and try to look busy.\n\nI can’t speak to their other services, but if you have a plumbing issue, save your money, and sanity, and hire someone else.",

        "ownerResponse": "Mr. Pierce, allow me to first say that we are not happy with the results of a service call if the customer is not happy. We take pride in our work and regret that you feel so incensed about your experience with us. In fact, management adjusted your bill when you voiced your concerns, and so this review took us by surprise.\n\nTo address a few of the items you mentioned: when we arrive at a customer location, we really must follow the appropriate steps to diagnose and address a problem. Though we understand that you attempted snaking and plunging, we must act based on knowledge and experience that a customer may not necessarily have. As far as the trip to acquire parts: despite the hose you had on hand, the technician also needed to acquire fittings and a correctly sized bladder. A trip was necessary, and you were not charged for that trip. Nor did we charge for any breaks or indeed any time that the technician was not working to solve your problem.\n\nOnce again, we regret your dissatisfaction, though we disagree with your characterization of the service we provided. We attempted to address your concerns with a billing adjustment and now this reply.",

        "text": "We bought a unit from them had them place it almost a year ago and it is not aorkinf our air went out. Called them at the beginning of week to have problem fixed, told us they could not get our til Thursday due to weather someone would be at my home at 8 am Thursday morning 3/18/21. Fast forward it Thursday no one has called, I can’t get anyone on the line the answering service keeps picking up. No one has called to tell me why no one has presented to my home like they promised. And I have been with AC for a whole week with my kids out for spring break! We are hot and upset. I am currently calling have left message and keep getting answering service and I hang up! Who not use. I’m very upset and disappointed and to make it worst the unit has a Warrenty and it not our fault why the unit is not working it’s covered under their warranty but I guess that doesn’t matter",

        "text": "Mr. Webb and his associate did a great job for my family.  Our old heat pump had broken down, and wasn't repairable, so Mr. Webb was able to get a new high quality heat pump unit at a very reasonable price, and got it installed smoothly and quickly.\n\nBefore I decided to make a purchase, Mr. Webb went over all of my options, and explained things to me in a way that someone who isn't a HVAC expert would understand.\n\nHe pointed out that the current refrigerant standard of R410A was being phased out at the end of this year, and was able to get me one based on the new standard (R32).\n\nIt's great to see that there are companies out there, especially small businesses, that are owned by honest folks who truly care about their customers.  I will definitely be using Mr. Webb's company for the forseeable future.",

I reached out and Hunter responded immediately (I had reached out to two other companies and never heard a word back). He arranged to come out just a few days later. Hunter and Austin were prompt, professional, friendly, and knowledgeable (and cleaned up before they left). They charged a reasonable price and told me up front how much it would cost.

These days, it can be rare to find companies or contractors that do a quality job, from the customer service to the finished work. And William far exceeded our expectations & delivered in all areas.

        "text": "Can't say enough good things about McCoy and Calvary Climate. Veteran owned and local family man, he's a great guy, very considerate and respectful.\n\nI called 3 places for service when our air went out on Saturday before Memorial Day, and each place wanted $225-$300 for an \"emergency\" holiday call, just to show up, not including parts, labor or fixing the problem.\n\nMcCoy showed up within 20 minutes of calling him and had our air fixed 10 minutes later. Total cost from Calvary Climate was less than just the service fee for showing up the other companies wanted.\n\nI'm getting him back out next week to clean and inspect the rest of my system before summer hits. Only a $69 fee you can't beat!\n\nIf you are having issues, do your family a favor and call, you can thank me later. Even if you aren't having issues now, the $69 fee is well worth the money to have him clean the coils, check all the capacitors, other system parts and the drainage. He won't lie or try to sell you anything you don't need, but he may find something that might become an issue and leave you without AC. Better to stay ahead of possible issues and replace things on your time frame rather than wake up hot and have no choice.",

When the technician arrived he told us he could not work on our AC because we live in a mobile home. He suggested another company, whom we called and set an appointment with for Thursday and they never showed. We were quite upset as the AC had been out since Monday, my husband found Calvary online and he called us back within about 5 minutes and was on his way here. He was here within the hour(mostly due to the travel time to us) and the AC was up and running within 30 minutes. Could not be happier with the service, price or knowledge!

There was some preventative maintenance he found and repaired to lessen the possibility of another problem. He explained each charge on the invoice so I knew exactly what I was paying for, plus he’s reasonably priced. I definitely recommend his service!",

        "text": "Dustin is a great guy. He makes sure to check what the problem is and not just fix what might be the problem to get you running. That way you’re not in a bind when it’s 100 degrees outside. He is definitely a man of integrity. He is willing to explain everything to help you better understand what is going on with your unit. I highly recommend Dustin for any type of HVAC issue you might have.",
